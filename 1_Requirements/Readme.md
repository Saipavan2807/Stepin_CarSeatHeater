This case study gives us the information about how the car seat warmer is working and how we can build it using atmega microcontroller.

__ACTIVITY1:__    
In this first activity, we are going to check whether the passenger or the person is seated in the car. If he is seated then a button gets on and checks the person is seated or not and after seating another button gets on which checks the temperature inside the car. So in generally we use two buttons to check the various funtions in the car.
